This website is an attemp to use HTML, CSS, and Javascript to create a "Choose Your Own Adventure" type game. 
I will be trying to create something similar to what I do when I DM a game of Dungeons & Dragons. 
This will be a little simpler than that since I'm not all too familiar with Javascript and what it's capable of.
So, for now it will be a more of a choice based game with different results depending on the choices.
Hopefully I can build on that later on down the line depending on whether I have use a coding language like Python or some type of Framework.
